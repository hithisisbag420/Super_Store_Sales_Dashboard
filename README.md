# Sales Performance Dashboard

## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing a retail store's sales performance to uncover critical insights and guide business improvements. By leveraging **Power BI** and advanced data modeling techniques, I created an interactive dashboard that highlights key metrics driving success, including sales trends, profitability, and regional performance.

2. **Identifying Key Trends**: Pinpointed price-sensitive regions and top-performing product categories.
3. **Enhancing Customer Segmentation**: Improved customer profiling to boost targeted marketing efforts.
4. **Visualizing Data**: Created intuitive charts and graphs to forecast seasonal trends and optimize decision-making.

## Tools and Technologies Used
